SnapIt - Snapshot tool

Snapit is freeware that runs as accessory or program
(although running as program in SingleTOS would only allow
you to grab the background ;)

It can generate screen snapshots in various formats:
ú (X)IMG (Atari format, for 1-8 bitplanes)
ú GIF (gif87a, for 1 to 8 bitplanes)
ú TGA (uncompressed, for 15-32 bitplanes)
ú PNG (all formats)

There are 3 versions available, in their corresponding subdirectories:
000: for plain 68000 (ST/STe etc)
020: for 68020 or better (TT/Falcon...)
v4e: for ColdFire


For PNG & JPEG output, you need to copy the shared library for your system
to some directory that is searched by $SLBPATH (for MiNT),
or to C:\MINT\SLB for SingleTOS. The shared libraries
are available in a separate archive.

It should work in all screen resolutions, with graphics cards, etc.
It is also able to create snapshots of chunky (8 bpp pixel-packed)
screen modes.

For 68000, there are 2 versions, both should be functional
identical, the only difference being that snapit.acc was compiled
by Pure-C. The other was compiled by GCC, but can also be
renamed as accessory.

The snapshots are written to the clipboard directory if that
exists, otherwise to the current directory (which is usually the
root directory of your boot drive when run as accessory).


Known bugs:

Some conversions (especially chunky format) might be quite slow.
